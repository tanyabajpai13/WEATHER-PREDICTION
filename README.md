 #Weather Prediction using Naive Bayes

##  Project Overview
This project shows a simple Machine Learning model to predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not based on weather factors such as outlook, temperature, humidity, and wind.

---

##  Algorithm Used
- Naive Bayes Algorithm  
- Bayes Theorem  
- Assumes all features are independent  

---

##  Dataset Description
The dataset used in our project contain the following features:

- Outlook -> Sunny, Overcast, Rain  
- Temperature -> Hot, Mild, Cool  
- Humidity -> High, Normal  
- Wind -> Weak, Strong  
- RainTomorrow -> Yes / No  

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## Steps for program

1. Create dataset using Pandas library   
2. Split dataset into training and testing sets  
3. Gaussian Naive Bayes helps to train model  
4. Result prediction 
5. Model provide accuracy score in percent and confusion matrix  

---

## Evaluation

- Accuracy Score → Measures how much program predicts correct 
- Confusion Matrix → Displays correct and incorrect predictions  

---

## How to Run
